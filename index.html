    <p>
      Croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry of Austrian origin, but
      mostly associated with France. Croissants are named for their historical
      crescent shape and, like other viennoiseries, are made of a layered
      yeast-leavened dough. The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded
      several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique
      called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture,
      similar to a puff pastry.
